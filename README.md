# SonyProjectorSwitch
Code for controlling Sony HWXXES using Z-uno

Since Sony HWXXES projectors require event parity, and z-uno does not support parity, a UART bridge is needed (see e.g. https://github.com/Risca/uart_bridge).

For testing the z-uno, checkout https://github.com/Risca/sony_projector_mock
